The software stack for this thesis involves primarily Python,
using the Anaconda package on the Ubuntu operating system.
We have employed a mix of the Atomic Simulation Environment,
the Atomistic Machine-learning Package (AMP) and parts of AMP implemented
in Fortran.

Nearly all calculations were performed on the 
\href{https://www.uio.no/english/services/it/research/hpc/abel/more/index.html}{Abel computing cluster},
hosted at the University of Oslo
\href{https://www.usit.uio.no/english/}{
University Center for Information Technology (USIT)} by the
Research Infrastructure Services group.
The Stillinger-Weber calculations were performed using my assigned computer
at the University of Oslo Computational Science group, with
an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6500 CPU @ 3.20GHz and 16 GB of RAM using
the Ubuntu 18.04 operating system.
