The Atomistic Machine-learning Package is a software package
written in Python with the intent of bringing machine learning
to electronic structure calculations. The software is intended
to interface with ASE and the OpenKIM API for usage
in LAMMPS. The interface to AMP is written purely in Python
while computationally intensive tasks are outsourced to Fortran
modules and the machine learning performed through a Tensorflow
backend. The Python interface makes AMP flexible and easily
extended, and this makes the package ideal for prototyping
and testing both newer and more established machine learning
methods.

A suggested workflow is as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use AMP for training, testing and validation
        of novel descriptors and systems
    \item Use the AMP calculator for smaller scale
        simulation in the ASE environment
    \item Export the network compliant with the OpenKIM
        API for usage in more mature, large-scale
        electronic structure calculations such as LAMMPS
\end{itemize}

Unfortunately, the software is not currently fully compliant
with the latest version of the OpenKIM API,
which introduces artifacts in the simulation.
However, the authors have recently received a large grant
from the U.S. Department of Energy\footnote{\url{

which should facilitate further development.
