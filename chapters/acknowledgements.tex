Thank you to my supervisor Morten Hjorth-Jensen for giving
me valuable advice and support. Through participation in
your courses you have given me the training required to plan,
structure and develop a large scientific project with good scientific
and ethical conduct. Your optimism and belief in me has guided
me through difficult times without which this work would not have been possible.
I would also like to thank Morten Ledum for providing valuable input
and insights in the early stages of developing this thesis.

I would also like to recognize the master theses of HÃ¥kon V. Treider
and John-Anders Stende, for providing me with a solid foundation from which
to build upon. Thank you to Andrew Peterson and Alizera Khorshidi
for their theoretical work on electronic structure calculations
using machine learning, and for developing and open sourcing
their Atomistic Machine-learning Package, without which this
thesis might have been made considerably more difficult.

Finally, thank you to the fine people at the Computational Physics
group, for many interesting conservations and for your extensive
enthusiasm and knowledge concerning physics and scientific programming.
